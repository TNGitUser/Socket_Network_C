Protocol :
	
	Loop : 
		- Server 0 : send command
		- Client X : receive command and stock it
		- Server 1 : send command size
		- Client X : check received data size and size sent by server
					If ok send	STATUS : OK
					else send	STATUS : FAIL
		- Server 2 : check return

	Init :
		- Server : Give identification to client
		- Client : Receive Identification and await command
		- Server : Send command (if sending show progression)
		- Client : Receive command and execute (if receiving show progression)
		- Client : Send end status
		- Server : Receive end status (shoz progression if receiving data)
		(- Client : Disconnect ?)

	RT needs :
		- Need to send zone to compute
		- Need to know if zone was computed or failed ?
		- Need to recuperate computed zone (sending back img_str I guess)
